Building resilient AI programmes requires a feedback loop between offensive testing, runtime detection, and governance.

## Establish the telemetry backbone

Start with signal collection across inference, training, and prompt orchestration layers. Normalize traces so threat-hunting queries can correlate user identities with model responses and retrieval context.

- Capture prompt/response pairs with secrets filtered.
- Retain retrieval metadata (vector hits, knowledge articles).
- Emit structured events for abuse heuristics (prompt injection, data exfil attempts).

## Run continuous adversarial testing

Red teams should automate exploit discovery against the telemetry pipeline.

> Treat your red/blue programme like an SRE discipline. Every finding must have an attached detection or block.

## Close the loop with response playbooks

Feed detections into pre-approved guardrail actions:

1. Flag high-risk interactions for human review in near real-time.
2. Trigger sensitivity aware fallback answers.
3. Record investigator notes for audit readiness.

Over time, this creates an asset library of guardrails, detections, and runbooks that can be tailored to product teams.
