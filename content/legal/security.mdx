# Security Overview

This site follows a security‑first approach using modern managed services and conservative defaults.

## Platform controls

- Supabase row‑level security (RLS) and service‑role separation for admin operations.
- Private Supabase Storage for sensitive assets (resumes) with short‑lived signed URLs.
- Strict Content Security Policy and transport security headers.
- Least privilege for environment credentials, stored and rotated via Doppler.

## Application controls

- Server actions with authentication guards for all admin mutations.
- Cloudflare Turnstile on contact submissions to reduce spam and abuse potential.
- Event logging for key actions (e.g., signed URL generation) to aid incident response.

## Data lifecycle

- Contact requests retained up to 24 months, then archived.
- Event logs retained up to 12 months.
- No persistent cookies beyond those required by Supabase auth.

## Responsible disclosure

If you believe you have found a vulnerability, please report it via the contact page with steps to reproduce. I’ll acknowledge receipt and follow up with remediation details.
