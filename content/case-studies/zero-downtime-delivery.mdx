Modernizing the delivery pipeline meant codifying every compliance requirement alongside progressive delivery guardrails.

## Approach

1. Built a GitOps workflow with signed container promotion.
2. Enforced policy-as-code for segregation of duties and CAB approvals.
3. Added automated fallbacks leveraging blue/green environments with database shadow traffic.

## Impact

- **28 automated releases per week** with zero repeat audit findings.
- Recovery time improved to **under 7 minutes** thanks to deterministic rollbacks.
