We built a secure software factory for model artefacts so downstream product teams could adopt generative tooling with confidence.

## Capabilities delivered

- End-to-end SBOM generation and attestation for model weights and prompt libraries.
- Secrets scanning across repositories, S3 buckets, and LangChain orchestrations.
- Automated risk scoring for third-party datasets and plug-ins.

### Outcomes

- Reduced manual review time by **7.3Ã—** while increasing coverage of compliance controls.
- Blocked **14 leaked prompts** before they reached production endpoints.

## Lessons learned

Treat models like high-value microservices: version them, attest them, and observe them. Security teams earn trust when controls are transparent and self-service for builders.
